### Introduction

Hi! I'm Anne Marie Kuebler, and I'm from St. Louis, MO. I am planning on majoring in kinesiology on either the pre-PA or pre-med track. In my free time I enjoy hanging out with friends, watching sports, and doing puzzles. I also love sweets and going to the beach. I am on the Women's Gymnastics team at W&M and am looking forward to a fun and exciting year!
