1. What was the toaster project? What Thomas Thwaites attempt to do? Was he successful and what is the significant of this example in the context of complexity and development?

The toaster project was when Thomas Thwaites tried to build a toaster from scratch using raw materials. He traveled around finding the basic items. He was successful but only for a brief period of time.
			i. He got suitcase of iron and melted it in microwave.
			ii. He showed that you can develop things from very little and from very cheap if you are willing to put in the work and time. We are able to accomplish goals and make things in different ways 
2. According to Barder, how successful have economic models been at describing and predicting growth over the past 50 years?  How did he use the Harrod-Domar model, the Solow model, the Washington consensus and the Ajoakuta Steel works to illustrate his point (reference at least two of the above).
		a. Economic models ha
		b. The Harrod-Domar growth model was a simple model that stated to get an output, capital and labor needed to occur. For example, to increase its output, a firm would need to increase its use of labor and capital. On the bigger scale, the economy is made up of these firms, so to increase the production of the economy, their needs to be more labor or more capital. For developing countries, there was always plenty of labor, so the capital was stopping them.
3. Who was Steve Jones? What did he do at uni-lever? Was he successful?  Specifically what did he do in order to make an evolutionary jump forward?  How significant were his results?
		a. Steve Jones used to work in a factory making soap powder, and he was hired to create/design a more efficient nozzle to spray the soap. He took the existing nozzle and made ten copies of it. He then altered each of the copies and determined which worked the best. Then he took that model, made 10 copies, distorted them, and so on for forty-five times. He used data and randomizing to find the best shape which no one could have come up with otherwise which allowed them to make the evolutionary jump forward. His new nozzle was hundreds of times more efficient than the original one. 
4. Who was Haile Sellasie?  What is the significance of Kapuscinski’s book, The Emporer?  According to Barder, how did Ethiopia exemplify the suppression of emergent systemic change?  How do you think Sen would have described this suppression? Do you agree?
Haile Sellasie was the Emperor of Ethiopia, the last of the dynasty. The Emporer, the book, showed the top-down model in action and the way that these regimes only cared for their own preservation and keeping their power as opposed to putting their energy towards developing the economic and social aspects of their country. Ethiopia was suppressed because
