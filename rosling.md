1. What was Hans Rosling's observation regarding his comparative survey of students at the Karolinska Institute and the Chimpanzees (as well as the faculty who decide the Nobel Prize)? What is the significance of the results from his informal survey on preconceived ideas?

* Rosling's survey showed that on average the students got 1.8, chimpanzees got 2.5, and faculty got 2.4 questions right out of 5. These results showed that students were impacted by preconceived ideas about each of the countries. The chimpanzees did better because they would just be picking one or the other. It showed that the students' view of the world was "we" (Western World) vs. "them" (third world countries).

2. What type of change took place in Asia that preceeded economic growth? Why was this type of change significant?

* Social change took place before economic growth. There was a shift from larger family size and shorter life spans to smaller family size and longer life expectancy. This changed the way people lived, and family planning also had an impact he mentioned.

3. In accordance with Hans Rosling's TED talk, what is the relationship between child mortality and GDP per capita?

* The linearity between child survival and GDP per capita is very strong. As money increases, child survival increases. This linearity is also seen in the different countries within the regions. They all show as money increases, so does survival.

4. In terms of income distribution, how has the world changed from 1962 until 2003?

* Most countries have trended to have more money. Countries have all started to use their money better now than in the past. All countries made improvements, but it is easier to make more money if you are healthier than if you are making money to become healthier. China and US used to barely have any overlap and China tended to be more over the $1,000, while the US was over $10,000 per person income. But it has shifted and China hovers over the US. 

5. What is the significance of how Hans Rosling uses data to describe global human development in terms of very high spatial and temporal resolutions? How does this relate to his previous observation regarding preconceived ideas?

* By zooming in on the different countries in each region, it gave a more accurate depiction of global health vs income. Looking at a region as a whole was giving an average of the data but that does not show the whole picture. Looking at the individual countries showed that some had more income with an increase then in survival of children, while others were on the lower end of the spectrum with less income correlating with lower child survival rates.

6. In your opinion, why was Hans Roslingâ€™s work with the Gapminder project significant in contributing towards advancing the intersection of data science and global human development?

* His Gapminder project was significant because it was starting to allow people to access information about public health. With people being able to access this data, they are able to learn about and understand global health statistics.
